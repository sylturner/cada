    <div class="text-left">
      <p>The City of Chamblee was incorporated on August 17, 1908. It is one of eight cities locaed within DeKalb County. Chamblee's history is intertwined with three entities - dairies, railroads and the military. For years, Chamblee was known fr its rolling hills and numerous dairies. The only thing that crisscrossed the pastures during the late 19th and early 20th century was the railroad. At the junction of what is now the Norfolk Southern Railroad and the Roswell Railroad and in 1917 the dairy land was transformed into Camp Gordon.</p>
